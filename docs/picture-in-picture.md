# Picture-in-Picture

Picture-in-Picture (PiP) allows users to record and playback in a floating window (always on top
of other windows) while interacting with other sites or applications.

Enable the PiP button with the `pip` option:

```javascript
record: {
    pip: true
    debug: true,
    video: true,
    maxLength: 20
}
```
